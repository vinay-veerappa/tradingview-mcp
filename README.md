# TradingView MCP Bridge

[![MCP Toplist](https://mcptoplist.com/badge/glama%2Ftradesdontlie%2Ftradingview-mcp.svg)](https://mcptoplist.com/server/glama%2Ftradesdontlie%2Ftradingview-mcp)

Personal AI assistant for your TradingView Desktop charts. Connects Claude Code to your locally running TradingView app via Chrome DevTools Protocol for AI-assisted chart analysis, Pine Script development, and workflow automation.

> [!WARNING]
> **This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with TradingView Inc.** It interacts with your locally running TradingView Desktop application via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Review the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires a valid TradingView subscription.** This tool does not bypass or circumvent any TradingView paywall or access control. It reads from and controls the TradingView Desktop app already running on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> MCP control and CDP communication occur locally. The active TradingView application and several tools can still make authenticated requests to TradingView services; this project does not guarantee that all data remains local.

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool accesses undocumented internal TradingView APIs via the Electron debug interface. These can change or break without notice in any TradingView update. Pin your TradingView Desktop version if stability matters to you.

## How It Works

This tool communicates with your locally running TradingView Desktop instance via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), a standard Chromium/Electron debugging interface. Code evaluated in the page context can use the active TradingView session and its network access.

The debug port is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by you using a standard Chromium flag (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`). Nothing happens without that deliberate step.

## What This Tool Does Not Provide

- Standalone or offline TradingView access; the Desktop session and some tools make authenticated service requests
- Automatic transmission or redistribution of market data to third parties
- Work without a valid TradingView subscription and installed Desktop app
- Bypass any TradingView paywall or access restriction
- Provide a broker-order API; replay trades use TradingView's historical replay API
- Work if TradingView changes their internal Electron structure

## Research Context

This project explores an open research question: **how can LLM-based agents interact with professional trading interfaces to support human decision-making?**

Specifically it investigates:

- How structured tool APIs (MCP) can bridge LLMs and stateful desktop financial applications
- What latency, context, and reliability constraints emerge when an agent operates on live chart data
- How agents handle ambiguous financial UI state (e.g. interpreting Pine Script output, reading indicator tables)
- Whether natural language is an effective interface for chart navigation and Pine Script development
- The failure modes of LLM agents operating in real-time data environments

This is not a trading bot. It is an interface layer that makes a trading application legible to an LLM agent, allowing researchers and developers to study human-AI collaboration in financial workflows.

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for open questions, findings, and related work.

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView Desktop app** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Claude Code** with MCP support (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## What It Does

Gives your AI assistant eyes and hands on your own chart:

- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read your chart's indicator values, price levels, and annotations
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal lines, rectangles, text annotations
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, and delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries/exits
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state for AI visual analysis
- **Multi-pane layouts** — set up 2x2, 3x1, etc. grids with different symbols per pane
- **Monitor your chart** — stream JSONL from your locally running chart for local monitoring scripts
- **CLI access** — every MCP tool is also a `tv` CLI command, pipe-friendly with JSON output
- **Launch TradingView** — auto-detect and launch with debug mode from any platform

## Security Boundaries

| Capability | Default | Boundary |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `ui_evaluate` | Disabled | Exact arbitrary-JavaScript acknowledgment required |
| `replay_trade` | Disabled | Exact simulated-position acknowledgment required |
| `tv_update` | Disabled | Exact self-update acknowledgment required; pulls and runs remote code |
| `alert_delete` (`delete_all`) | Enabled | Irreversible bulk delete requires an exact `confirm` token; a bare `delete_all` is refused |
| Replay navigation | Enabled | `start`, `step`, `autoplay`, `status`, and `stop` do not require the trade capability |

The exact opt-in values are documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); generic truthy flags are rejected. `replay_trade` only changes TradingView's internal Bar Replay simulated positions. Replay and paper trading are not the same as enforced isolation: the MCP cannot verify account type or guarantee that a real broker is disconnected. Use replay only with real broker connections removed.

Generic UI controls can click and type into whatever TradingView currently displays. Other state-changing tools can modify charts, alerts, scripts, layouts, watchlists, local files, or this checkout.

## Install with Claude Code

Paste this into Claude Code and it will handle the rest:

> Install the TradingView MCP server. Clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git, run npm install, add it to my MCP config at ~/.claude/.mcp.json, and launch TradingView with the debug port. Then verify the connection with tv_health_check.

Or follow the manual steps below.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git
cd tradingview-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView Desktop must be running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled on port 9222.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_mac.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\launch_tv_debug.bat
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv_debug_linux.sh
```

**Or launch manually on any platform:**
```bash
/path/to/TradingView --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**Or use the MCP tool** (auto-detects your install):
> "Use tv_launch to start TradingView in debug mode"

### 3. Add to Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/.mcp.json` or project `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tradingview-mcp/src/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/tradingview-mcp` with your actual path.

### 4. Verify

Ask Claude: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected"*

## CLI

Every MCP tool is also accessible as a `tv` CLI command. All output is JSON for piping with `jq`.

```bash
# Install globally (optional)
npm link

# Or run directly
node src/cli/index.js <command>
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
tv status                          # check connection
tv quote                           # current price
tv symbol AAPL                     # change symbol
tv ohlcv --summary                 # price summary
tv screenshot -r chart             # capture chart
tv pine compile                    # compile Pine Script
tv pane layout 2x2                 # 4-chart grid
tv pane symbol 1 ES1!              # set pane symbol
tv stream quote | jq '.close'      # monitor price changes
```

### All Commands

```
tv status / launch / state / symbol / timeframe / type / info / search
tv quote / ohlcv / values
tv data lines/labels/tables/boxes/strategy/trades/equity/depth/indicator
tv pine get/set/compile/analyze/check/save/new/open/list/errors/console
tv draw shape/list/get/remove/clear
tv alert list/create/delete
tv watchlist get/add
tv indicator add/remove/toggle/set/get
tv layout list/switch
tv pane list/layout/focus/symbol
tv tab list/new/close/switch
tv replay start/step/stop/status/autoplay/trade
tv stream quote/bars/values/lines/labels/tables/all
tv ui click/keyboard/hover/scroll/find/eval/type/panel/fullscreen/mouse
tv screenshot / discover / ui-state / range / scroll
tv gateway                          # loopback HTTP read surface + SSE
```

## Streaming

The `tv stream` commands poll your locally running TradingView Desktop instance at regular intervals via Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost.

The MCP-to-Desktop transport is local. The authenticated TradingView Desktop session may still receive data from TradingView services, and stream output is written to local stdout where downstream consumers can store or transmit it.

> [!WARNING]
> Programmatic consumption of TradingView data may conflict with their Terms of Use regardless of the data source. You are solely responsible for ensuring your usage complies.

```bash
tv stream quote                          # price tick monitoring
tv stream bars                           # bar-by-bar updates
tv stream values                         # indicator value monitoring
tv stream lines --filter "NY Levels"     # price level monitoring
tv stream tables --filter Profiler       # table data monitoring
tv stream all                            # all panes at once (multi-symbol)
```

## How Claude Knows Which Tool to Use

Claude reads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) automatically when working in this project. It contains a complete decision tree:

| You say... | Claude uses... |
|------------|---------------|
| "What's on my chart?" | `chart_get_state` → `data_get_study_values` → `quote_get` |
| "What levels are showing?" | `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` |
| "What are the named levels?" | `data_get_pine_labels` with `normalize: true` (or gateway `GET /levels`) |
| "Read the session table" | `data_get_pine_tables` with `study_filter` |
| "Give me a full analysis" | `quote_get` → `data_get_study_values` → `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` → `data_get_pine_tables` → `data_get_ohlcv` (summary) → `capture_screenshot` |
| "Switch to AAPL daily" | `chart_set_symbol` → `chart_set_timeframe` |
| "Write a Pine Script for..." | `pine_set_source` → `pine_smart_compile` → `pine_get_errors` |
| "Start replay at March 1st" | `replay_start` → `replay_step` → `replay_trade` |
| "Set up a 4-chart grid" | `pane_set_layout` → `pane_set_symbol` for each pane |
| "Draw a level at 24500" | `draw_shape` (horizontal_line) |
| "Take a screenshot" | `capture_screenshot` |

## Tool Reference (104 MCP tools)

> Tools are **profiled**: the default `base` profile exposes 30; `pine`, `control`,
> `paper` add more; `devel` = everything. `system_status` shows what is visible.
> Set via `TRADINGVIEW_MCP_PROFILE` or the `profile_set` tool.

|------|------|
| `pine_set_source` | 1. Inject code into editor |
| `pine_smart_compile` | 2. Compile with auto-detection + error check |
| `pine_get_errors` | 3. Read compilation errors if any |
| `pine_get_console` | 4. Read log.info() output |

### Paper Trading (native only)

Tools talk only to TradingView's **native Paper Trading** provider (stable broker id `Paper`). Mutations fail closed if any other broker is active. Evidence and paths: [docs/PAPER_TRADING_DISCOVERY.md](docs/PAPER_TRADING_DISCOVERY.md).

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `paper_get_status` | Session, panel, connection, broker id, `safe_for_paper_mutation` |

| `paper_get_account` / `paper_list_accounts` / `paper_switch_account` | Account summary and switch active Paper account |
| `paper_list_positions` / `paper_list_orders` | Open positions and active/history orders |
| `paper_place_order` | Market/limit/stop/stop_limit; optional TIF (`DAY`/`WEEK`/`MONTH`/`GTD`) and SL/TP |
| `paper_cancel_order` / `paper_modify_order` | Manage working orders |
| `paper_close_position` / `paper_set_brackets` | Close positions; set or clear SL/TP |

CLI: `tv paper status|panel|connect|account|accounts|switch-account|positions|orders|place|cancel|modify|close|brackets`.

If the MCP/CLI points at the wrong Desktop instance, set `TV_CDP_PORT` (and optionally `TV_CDP_HOST`) to the process launched with `--remote-debugging-port`.

## HTTP Gateway (loopback)

Optional read surface + Server-Sent-Events for local consumers that are not MCP clients:

```bash
tv gateway                 # http://127.0.0.1:9223 — read-only by default
```

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /health`, `/capabilities` | Liveness, profile + registry introspection |
| `GET /state`, `/quote`, `/ohlcv`, `/values`, `/panes` | Chart reads (same core calls as the tools) |
| `GET /snapshot` | Full `session_snapshot` (`?preset=analysis`, `?normalize=true` for named levels) |
| `GET /levels` | P2-10 named levels only — PDH/PDL/OR/settlement parsed for you (`?categories=session,ict`) |
| `GET /compat`, `/diagnostics`, `/pine/analyze` | Compatibility report, CDP diagnostics, offline Pine analysis |
| `GET /paper/status`, `/paper/account`, `/paper/positions`, `/paper/orders` | Paper reads |
| `GET /stream/{quote,bars,values,panes}` | SSE streams (SSE disconnect cancels polling) |

**Mutations (ADR 0001)** are disabled by default and stay that way unless BOTH gates arm: the op
cites `meta.mutation_adr` in the registry AND you start the gateway with
`TV_GATEWAY_MUTATIONS=on`. Then paper-only routes exist: `POST /paper/connect`,
`POST /paper/orders` (**requires `client_order_id` in the body** — the same id on retry
replays the original outcome instead of duplicating), `POST /paper/orders/cancel`,
`PATCH /paper/orders/modify`, `POST /paper/positions/close`, `PATCH /paper/brackets`.
Non-loopback peers get 403 even with the flag on; destructive ops are never HTTP-bindable.
Details: [docs/adr/0001-mutation-routes.md](docs/adr/0001-mutation-routes.md).

Binds 127.0.0.1 only — no auth beyond loopback; do not expose it.

#### Why `TV_GATEWAY_MUTATIONS` exists

The flag is not caution theater — it is the gateway's *only* auth. Constraints that make it
load-bearing:

- **Loopback is not an identity check.** Every process on your machine can reach
  127.0.0.1:9223. More importantly, YOUR BROWSER reaches it too: web pages can freely SEND
  requests to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...` (CORS only blocks reading responses, not firing
  POSTs — the classic drive-by/CSRF-against-localhost attack). With the gate off, a tab on a
  random charting website that POSTs `/paper/orders` gets a 404 and nothing happens. With the
  gate on, it could fabricate paper fills, cancel working orders, or close positions — silently.
- **Read/write asymmetry.** A leaked market read is an annoyance; an unauthenticated state
  change corrupts a replay or a scripted strategy run with no visible trace.
- **Consistency with the rest of the surface.** The [Security Boundaries](#security-boundaries)
  table already uses disabled-until-explicit-ack for every high-consequence capability
  (`ui_evaluate`, `replay_trade`, `tv_update`). The transport gate is the same pattern, one
  layer down — one exact value (`on`), generic truthy values (`1`, `true`, `yes`) are rejected.
- **It does not gate *you*.** Every mutation remains available unflagged over MCP and the CLI.
  The flag gates everything else on the machine, at the cost of one env var when you choose to
  run an order-capable HTTP surface.

> If this ever feels heavier than the risk it covers (e.g. you never browse on the trading
> machine), the graduated middle ground — flag `on` arms only idempotent mutate ops while
> place/close still require a second acknowledgment — is a one-line ADR amendment, not a
> redesign. Filed as an open trade-off in the ADR's alternatives section.

```powershell
# Arming mutations (PowerShell) — the gateway startup banner confirms the posture:
$env:TV_GATEWAY_MUTATIONS = 'on'; tv gateway
# Example: place an idempotent paper order over HTTP
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9223/paper/orders `
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' `
  -d '{"side":"buy","type":"limit","qty":1,"price":24400,"client_order_id":"my-unique-key-001"}'
# Retry the SAME body after a timeout → the ORIGINAL outcome replays (deduplicated: true),
# never a second fill. Change the id → a genuinely new order.
```

## Context Management

Tools return compact output by default to minimize context usage. For a typical "analyze my chart" workflow, total context is ~5-10KB instead of ~80KB.

| Feature | How it saves context |
|---------|---------------------|
| Pine lines | Returns deduplicated price levels only, not every line object |
| Pine labels | Capped at 50 per study, text+price only |
| Pine tables | Pre-formatted row strings, no cell metadata |
| Pine boxes | Deduplicated {high, low} zones only |
| OHLCV summary mode | Stats + last 5 bars instead of all bars |
| Indicator inputs | Encrypted/encoded blobs auto-filtered |
| `verbose: true` | Pass on any pine tool to get raw data with IDs/colors when needed |
| `study_filter` | Target one indicator instead of scanning all |

## Finding TradingView on Your System

Launch scripts and `tv_launch` auto-detect TradingView. If auto-detection fails:

| Platform | Common Locations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Mac** | `/Applications/TradingView.app/Contents/MacOS/TradingView` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TradingView\TradingView.exe`, `%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps\TradingView*\TradingView.exe` |
| **Linux** | `/opt/TradingView/tradingview`, `~/.local/share/TradingView/TradingView`, `/snap/tradingview/current/tradingview` |

The key flag: `--remote-debugging-port=9222`

## Testing

```bash
# Offline/unit release gate (does not require a live TradingView target)
npm test

# Focused PR1 transport/layout tests
npm run test:focused

# Opt-in bounded live canary. Requires the authenticated TradingView Desktop
# chart target on localhost:9222 and opens (but never saves) three layouts.
npm run test:layout-canary

# Broad, state-mutating live tool suite; run separately and deliberately.
npm run test:e2e
```

The layout canary opens `Analysis - Stock Database`, `Analysis - Peers`, and
`Analysis - Against Index` sequentially. Each switch has one hard 20-second
deadline and must verify layout identity and stable chart API/pane state. After
the in-memory lightweight screenshot, a fresh read-only layout snapshot must
still match the layout, every pane, and pane geometry; the canary exits nonzero
on a timeout or false success. Optional
`layout_switch` inputs `expected_pane_signature` and `expected_symbol` add
fail-closed verification without changing callers that pass only `name`.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code  ←→  MCP Server (stdio, profiled)  ←→  CDP (port 9222)  ←→  TradingView Desktop (Electron)
                     │
                     ├─ Operation registry (P2-19): one definition per op → MCP tools + HTTP gateway routes
                     ├─ Loopback gateway (tv gateway): GET read surface, SSE streams, ADR-0001 paper mutations
                     └─ subscribe(kind): transport-neutral AsyncIterable → CLI JSONL · MCP resource updates · SSE
```

- **Transport**: MCP over stdio (104 tools across profiles) + CLI (`tv` command) + optional loopback HTTP gateway (SSE)
- **Connection**: Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost:9222
- **Streaming**: transport-neutral subscription primitive with per-subscriber cancellation
- **Safety**: annotation-derived access classes, P2-5 preconditions, P2-6 order idempotency, P2-4 stable error envelope — one registry is the single source of truth
- **No dependencies** beyond `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `chrome-remote-interface`
